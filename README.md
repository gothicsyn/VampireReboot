Unity 5 version and code of the original game

This will be an updated Unity 5 version of the original game I began building a while back.
It's wise to note this is a learning project for myself as I try to teach myself C# coding with Unity.
It will be a combination of tutorials and Youtube stuff all thrown together and edited as needed to hopefully create a working game.

Edits and revisions to the code-base can be found on the Commits page of the Github account.

Details on updates to environments and the newest builds will be found on the website.
